# TTK4145 Sanntidsprogrammering

## Elevator Project
The goal of the Elevator project is to create software for controlling `n` elevators working in parallel across `m` floors. The main requirements of the elevators can be summarized as

- **No orders are lost**
- **Multiple elevators should be more efficient than one**
- **An individual elevator should behave sensibly and efficiently**
- **The lights and buttons should function sd expected**

We have chosen to implement this software using The `Go` programming language.

### Utilized code
In the project we have used the following pre-made code:
- [`bcast.go`](https://github.com/TTK4145/Network-go/blob/master/network/bcast/bcast.go), [`conn.go`](https://github.com/TTK4145/Network-go/tree/master/network/conn), [`localip.go`](https://github.com/TTK4145/Network-go/blob/master/network/localip/localip.go) and [`peers.go`](https://github.com/TTK4145/Network-go/blob/master/network/peers/peers.go) from the [Network-go module](https://github.com/TTK4145/Network-go/tree/master/network)
- [`hall_request_assigner`](https://github.com/TTK4145/Project-resources/tree/master/cost_fns) from [Project-resources](https://github.com/TTK4145/Project-resources)

Additionally, we used slightly modified versions of the pre-made code [`main.go`](https://github.com/TTK4145/driver-go/blob/master/main.go) and [`elevator_io.go`](https://github.com/TTK4145/driver-go/blob/master/elevio/elevator_io.go) from the [driver-go module](https://github.com/TTK4145/driver-go), and we based some of our code on the `C`-code given in [`elev_algo`](https://github.com/TTK4145/Project-resources/tree/master/elev_algo) from [Project-resources](https://github.com/TTK4145/Project-resources)

### Our code
Our code is divided into [`main.go`](), a [`system`]()-package and the five modules [`hardwareIO`](), [`fsm`](), [`distributor`](),  [`network`]() and [`timer`]().

#### Main script
Takes care of the systems' process-pair functionality, creates channels for use between modules, and initiates go-routines.

#### System-package
In the system package one will find [`sys_types.go`]() which defines the types used in our code, [`sys_funcs.go`]() which defines general system functionality (process-pairs, backup log), and [`sys_config.go`]() where one can configure the system according to hardware (# elevators, # floors, elevator ID, etc.).
When running our software two files will be created in this package; a system log .json-file and a primary documentation .txt-file.

#### HardwareIO module
Consists of [`hardwareIO.go`]() which defines the hardwareIO go-routines, and [`hardwareIO_funcs.go`]() which defines functions used by the hardwareIO go-routines.
The hardwareIO module handles hardware input and output, as well as monitoring the motor to detect motor stop. 

#### FSM module
Consists of [`fsm.go`]() which defines the FSM go-routines, and [`fsm_funcs.go`]() which defines functions used by the FSM go-routines.
The FSM module controls the state of the elevator based on input from hardwareIO. It also shares the elevator state with the distributor module.

#### Distributor module
Consists of [`distributor.go`]() which defines the distributor go-routines, and [`distributor_funcs.go`]() which defines functions used by the distributor go-routines. 
The distributor module handles all hall orders from the elevators' hall panel, keeps track of state-information shared on the network, and times messages for order distribution as well as the order execution itself.

#### Network module
Consists of the packages [`bcast.go`](), [`conn.go`]() and [`peers.go`]() which is pre-made code we have utilized. 
It also consists of the package [`sendandreceive`]() with [`sendandreceive.go`](), which defines our go-routines that handles the systems' networking (sharing elevator states, sending orders, detecting peer connect/disconnect).

#### Timer module
Consists of [`timer.go`](), which defines three go-routine timers. They are for timing the opening of the elevator doors, timing communication of orders over the network, and timing order execution.
